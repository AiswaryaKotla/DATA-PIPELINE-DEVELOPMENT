**DESCRIPTION**:
This project involves building a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to automate data processing. The pipeline begins by extracting data from a source, typically a CSV file, using pandas. The extracted data is then transformed, which may include handling missing values, converting data types, and enriching the data. A common issue, SettingWithCopyWarning, is resolved by using the .loc indexer to modify the DataFrame correctly. After transformation, the data is loaded into a target system, such as a new CSV file, using to_csv(). The pipeline is designed to handle varying data sizes and can be automated to run periodically. Error handling ensures the process runs smoothly, even with missing or incorrectly formatted data. The ETL pipeline streamlines data processing, making it efficient, scalable, and easily integrated into larger workflows. It also offers the flexibility to expand, such as integrating with databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. This project demonstrates how Python can automate and manage data pipelines effectively, ensuring consistency and reducing manual intervention in data workflows.
